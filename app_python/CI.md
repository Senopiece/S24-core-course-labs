# Best Practices for Workflow Management

## `checks.yml` - Checking the Codebase Workflow

### 1. Triggering Conditions
- Initiate workflows on specific triggers, such as a push to certain paths (`app_python/**`), to ensure that checks are relevant and efficient.

### 2. Environment Specification
- Use a consistent environment (`ubuntu-latest`) across different jobs to maintain compatibility and predictability.

### 3. Python Setup
- Utilize `actions/setup-python` to specify Python versions precisely (`3.12.2`), ensuring that the workflow is compatible with the project's requirements.
- Leverage caching (`pip`) to speed up dependency installation.

### 4. Dependency Management
- Upgrade `pip` before installing dependencies to take advantage of the latest features and security fixes.
- Separate production and development dependencies to minimize the production environment's attack surface.

### 5. Code Quality and Security
- Integrate tools like `flake8` for linting and `pytest` for testing to ensure code quality.
- Incorporate security scanning tools (e.g., Snyk) to detect vulnerabilities early, with appropriate handling of continuation on error to ensure workflow progression.

### 6. SARIF Upload
- For security jobs, output results in SARIF format and upload them to GitHub Code Scanning, enabling a comprehensive view of code security posture directly within the GitHub repository.

## `deploy.yml` - Deployment Workflow

### 1. Triggering Conditions
- Configure workflows to trigger on specific GitHub events, such as a release creation, to automate deployment in response to project milestones.

### 2. Docker Integration
- Securely log into DockerHub using secrets (`DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD`) to maintain security and access control.
- Build and push Docker images using `docker/build-push-action`, specifying context and Dockerfile locations to ensure accuracy in the build process.
- Tag images with both the release tag and as `latest` to provide version-specific and latest options for users.
- Utilize Docker's cache features (`cache-from` and `cache-to`) to speed up image building and reduce redundant computations.
